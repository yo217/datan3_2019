  - Assignment 1: marks and feedback
- Assignment 2
- Tidy data and reshaping
- Homework for next week

## Exercises

1. Join individual-level substantive data for the first three waves of the Understabding Society (*indresp* files). Keep the balanced panel only (i.e. individuals who participated in all three waves). Keep only the following variables: pidp, derived sex and age, and total net personal income (*fimnnet_dv*).

2. Calculate the average difference in monthly income between waves 1 and 2, and waves 2 and 3.

3. Estimate and interpret a linear model showing how income is associated with age and sex, for wave 1. Can you do it for all three waves of UndSoc at the same time?

4. Reshape the data from the wide to long format (check http://abessudnov.net/dataanalysis3/tidy-data.html).

5. Estimate a model showing how income depends on age and sex for all three waves, adding dummy variables for wave. Remember that the association between income and age is often non-linear and account for this in your models.

6. In the long data set, create two variables showing income in the previous and subsequent wave. Use the *lead* and *lag* window functions from **dplyr**: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html . Summarise the differences in incomes between waves 1 and 2, and 2 and 3.

7. Use the three original data tables for waves 1 to 3 and combine them in the long format. (check *bind_rows*). Now convert into the wide format.
