## Exercises

1. Read the *indresp* file from Wave 8 and keep the following variables: pidp, derived sex and age, ethnic group (h_indresp), government office region (h_gor_dv), and net personal income (h_fimnnet_dv).

For all charts use ggplot2. You may need to clean and recode variable before visualising.

We will start with univariate distributions.

2. Visualise the distribution of income with a histogram, a density plot and a box plot.

3. Visualise the distribution of sex with a bar graph. 

Bivariate distributions.

4. Create a bart chart showing mean income by region. Then make a grouped bart chart showing mean income by region for men and women separately.

5. Make a dot plot showing the same information as above (without splitting by sex). Sort regions in the descending order by mean income.

6. Make a line chart showing mean income by age. Make another chart showing the association for men and women separately.

7. Create a scatterplot showing the association between age and income for randomly selected 100 men in the sample. Now display a smoothing curve on the same graph showing the association between age and income.
