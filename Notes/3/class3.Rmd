Plan for today:

1. Test assignment.
2. The **tidyverse** framework (https://www.tidyverse.org/).
3. Reading in data with **readr**.
4. Transforming data with **dplyr**.
5. Statistical assignment 1: questions.
6. Homework for next week.

Importing data: read ch.11 from R for Data Science (Data import): https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html and ch.2 from my website (Read data): http://abessudnov.net/dataanalysis3/readdata.html.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Data <- read_tsv("data/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_wx/xwavedat.tab")
```

This is a cross-wave data file with stable characteristics of individuals. See the codebook at https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/dataset-documentation/wave/xwave/datafile/xwavedat.

See the dplyr cheetsheet: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf

Exercises.

1. Select the variables for: sex (derived), date of bith (derived), ethnic group (racel_dv). Also keep the cross-wave identifier (pidp) and the sample origin variable (memorig). 
```{r}
subset(Data, select = c("pidp", "memorig", "sex_dv", "doby_dv", "racel_dv"))
## method 1
```
```{r}
select(Data, pidp, memorig, sex_dv, doby_dv, racel_dv)
## method 2, less faff
```
```{r}
Data <- Data %>%
  select(pidp, memorig, sex_dv, doby_dv, racel_dv)
## method 3, using pipes, auto showing the names of variables from the dataset, thus less likely to make typos.
```

2. Filter the data to keep (in new data frames):
        a) men only.
        b) people born before 1950 and after 1975.
        c) men of Pakistani origin born in 1958 or 1982. 
```{r}
new1 <- Data %>%
  filter(sex_dv == 1)

new2 <- Data %>%
  filter((doby_dv > 0 & doby_dv < 1950) | doby_dv > 1975) 

new3 <- Data %>%
  filter(sex_dv == 1 & racel_dv == 10 & (doby_dv == 1958 | doby_dv == 1982))
```

d) people born within the range of 1950 and 1975
```{r}
Data %>%
  filter(doby_dv %in% 1950:1975) %>%
  head(3)
```

Discuss: logical operators.

3. Recode birth year into cohorts (a new variable): the G.I. Generation (born before 1924), Silent Generation (1925-42), Baby Boomers (1943-65), Generation X (1966-1980), Millenials (1981-99), Generation Z (2000-). (The years are approximate.)
```{r}
Data <- Data %>%
  mutate(generation = case_when(
    between(doby_dv, 0, 1924) ~ "G.I. Generation",
    between(doby_dv, 1925, 1942) ~ "Silent Generation",
    between(doby_dv, 1943, 1965) ~ "Baby Boomers",
    between(doby_dv, 1966, 1980) ~ "Generation X",
    between(doby_dv, 1981, 1999) ~ "Millenials",
    doby_dv >= 2000 ~ "Generation Z"
  ))
Data %>% 
  pull(generation) %>% 
  class()

Data %>% 
  pull(generation) %>% 
  table()
```

4. Recode ethnicity into the following groups: white British, Other White, Indian, Pakistani, other. (This classification doesn't make much sense, but we're doing this as an exercise).

Discuss: numeric and character vectors (strings), factors. Missing values in R.

5. Count the number of people belonging to different ethnic groups (and produce percentages). 
```{r}
Data %>%
  count(racel_dv) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/ sum(n) * 100)
```

6. Summarise the proportion of white British by generation.
```{r}
Data %>%
  filter(racel_dv != -9) %>%
  mutate(whiteBritish = if_else(racel_dv == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(generation) %>%
  summarise(
    propWhiteBritish = mean(whiteBritish, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  )
```

7. Summarise the proportion of women by birth year.
```{r}
Data %>%
  mutate(women = if_else(sex_dv == 2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(doby_dv) %>% 
  summarise(
    propWomen = mean(women, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  )
```
